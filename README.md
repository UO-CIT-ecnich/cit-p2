# Description
For Project 2, I completed a series of tasks to enhance my understanding of git usage and JavaScript code refactoring. It was a valuable learning experience, and here's a recap of what I accomplished:

Firstly, I finished Lab 2 and saved the "lab-02.zip" file in the designated "cit281/p2" folder. This served as a prerequisite for the project.

The main part of the project involved refactoring the JavaScript code from Project 1, with the goal of improving code structure and readability. I focused on dividing the code into smaller functions, eliminating global variables, and selecting meaningful names for variables and functions. This made the code more modular and easier to understand.

To manage version control and collaboration, I used git via the command line interface (CLI) and Visual Studio Code (VSCode). I created a new sub-folder called "refactor" within the "cit281/p2" folder and initialized it as a git repository. This allowed me to track changes and easily revert to previous versions if needed.

In the "refactor" folder, I created a new JavaScript file called "p2-random.js" using the provided solution from Canvas as a starting point. I updated the file's documentation section with the correct project number and my name for clarity.

To ensure the code worked correctly, I used VSCode to run and test it. I made necessary adjustments until the code produced the expected output.

I added the "p2-random.js" file to git and made an initial commit with the documentation message "First commit." This captured the initial version of the refactored code.

Next, I implemented the "getRandomLetter()" function, which generated a random lowercase letter. I also updated the code to incorporate this function appropriately. I retested the code in VSCode to confirm its accuracy and then staged and committed the changes with the documentation message "Added getRandomLetter()."

After that, I worked on the "getRandomString(minLength, maxLength)" function, which returned a random-length string within a specified range. I adjusted the parameters of the "getRandomInteger()" function accordingly and modified the code to use the new "getRandomString()" function. I tested the code again to ensure it met the desired requirements. I staged and committed these changes with the documentation message "Added getRandomString()."

Lastly, I added the "getSortedString(string)" function, which rearranged a given string in ascending order. To accomplish this, I utilized appropriate array methods. I carefully tested the code in VSCode, making sure it produced the expected output. I staged and committed these final changes with the documentation message "Added getSortedString()."

To maintain good documentation and provide an overview of the project, I used git commands to generate two important files. The first one, "p2-random-files.txt," listed all the files in the git repository, and the second one, "p2-random-commits.txt," displayed a log of the repository's changes with corresponding commit messages.

Overall, Project 2 was an excellent opportunity for me to gain practical experience with git, enhance my JavaScript coding skills, and understand the importance of proper documentation and version control in software development.
